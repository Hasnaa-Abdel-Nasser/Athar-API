  * system designed to facilitate donations and volunteer work in impoverished countries.
  * Increasing peopleâ€™s awareness of unknown countries that need assistance by presenting some of the problems of each country that needs assistance, then displaying convoys and donation boxes to them and charitable organizations supporting these countries.
  * The system involves creating convoys of volunteers who travel to these countries with donation boxes to provide aid to those in need. 
  * The donations can include food, clothing, medical supplies, and other essential items. 
  * The volunteers can also provide assistance in building infrastructure, providing education, and other forms of support. 
  * Volunteers can participate in their jobs to help poor countries, such as doctors, teachers, builders, and others
  * The system aims to create a sustainable solution to poverty by empowering local communities and providing them with the resources they need to thrive. With the Global Aid Convoy, we can make a difference in the lives of those who need it most.
